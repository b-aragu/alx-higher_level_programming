## Summary: Python - Everything is an Object

In Python, the philosophy of "Everything is an Object" is a fundamental principle that emphasizes the object-oriented nature of the language. It means that every value or entity in Python is represented as an object, including integers, strings, functions, modules, and even classes themselves. This concept enables a consistent and unified approach to programming in Python.

### Objects and Variables

In Python, when we create a value, it is stored in memory and referred to by a variable. However, it's important to understand that the variable is not the actual value but rather a reference to the object in memory. This is different from some other programming languages where variables directly hold the values.

```python
# Example: Variables referencing objects
x = 42
y = "Hello"

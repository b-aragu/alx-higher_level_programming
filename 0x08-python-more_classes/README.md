- It is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to organize code. Objects represents real world entities and classes define their structure and behaviours.
- Attribute- a piece of data associated with an object (instance of the class ), a data member of a class 
- method - A function defined within a class that can operates on the class attribute and methods within those methods
1. __Class__  - It is a template/ blueprint for creating objects(instances). It defines a set of attributes(data members) and functions(methods) thats the object class will have. They are basically the building blocks of OOP
2. Encapsulation - The bundling of data(attributes) and the methods(functions) that operates on the data into a single unit known as a `class`. A class hide the internal state and behaviour of an object from the outside
3. Abstraction - process of simplifying complex system by modelling classes or objects based on real world entities. `data abstraction = data encapsulation + data hiding`, it is representing essential features while hiding unnecessary details.
4. Information hiding  - It is the simple that some internal information maybe hidden so that it cant be changed accidentally. Restricting access to certain attributes or methods to prevent unauthorized access 
5. Inheritance - mechanism in OOP that allows you to create a new class (derived class or subclass) based on an existing class.
6. property - a speacial attribute in python that allows you to define getter and setter methods for attribute. It provides control over attributes while maintaining a clean interface.
7. `__str__` returns a user friendly string rep of an object
8. `__repr__` returns an unambiguos formal string rep of an object
9. class attribute - a variable associated with the class itself shared among all instances of the class .
10. object attribute is specific to an instance and varies from one instance to another.
11.  class methods - method that is bound to the class and not an instance, takes the class as its first arguement `cls`
12. Static method - method that belongs to a class rather than instance 
13. `__dict__ of a class ` - dictionary that contains the attributes of the class or instance
